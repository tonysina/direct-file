                A 1099-G is used by federal, state, and local government agencies to report payments of unemployment
                compensation and other kinds of government payments.
            - p: >-
                Depending on the agency that issued it, 1099-G forms may look different, but they should all have the

                Anyone who received {{/minimumUnemploymentCompensation}} or more in unemployment compensation in one tax
                year should get a 1099-G from their state unemployment agency reporting what was paid.
            - p: >-
                You may not get a 1099-G if the unemployment compensation was under

            - p: >-
                Most agencies provide a paper copy of a 1099-G by January 31 of each year. If you lost or never received
                your 1099-G, ask the agency that made the payments for a copy. If you still haven’t received the missing

                Generally, the amounts a person withdraws from a retirement plan before they reach age 59½ are called

                10% early withdrawal tax unless a qualified exception applies. For example, a qualified exception would
                apply to an early distribution made to a terminally ill employee.

            - p: >-
                Whether the election increases or decreases the amount of EITC depends on your total earned income,
                filing status, and number of qualifying children who have valid Social Security numbers.
            - p: >-
                Including or excluding combat pay only affects the amount of the credit; it does not affect your taxable
                income. Combat pay is always nontaxable.

                The custodial parent is the parent with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights during the

            - p: >-
                If the parents divorced or separated during the year and the child lived with both parents before the
                separation, the custodial parent is the one with whom the child lived for the greater number of nights

                If the child lived with each parent for an equal number of nights during the year, the custodial parent

                If a child wasn’t with either parent on a particular night (for example, the child was staying at a
                friend’s house), the child is treated as living with the parent with whom the child normally would have
                lived for that night, except for the absence. But if it can’t be determined with which parent the child
                normally would have lived or if the child would not have lived with either parent that night, the child
                is treated as not living with either parent that night.
            - p: <strong>Parent works at night</strong>
            - p: >-
                If, due to a parent’s nighttime work schedule, a child lives for a greater number of days, but not
                nights, with the parent who works at night, that parent is treated as the custodial parent. On a school
                day, the child is treated as living at the primary residence registered with the school.

            - p: >-
                Here are a few things that can help you decide if it’s better to file jointly (using Married Filing
                Jointly filing status) or file separately (using Married Filing Separately filing status).
            - p: <strong>Taxes on your income</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file jointly, your tax may be lower than your combined tax if you file
                separately. This means you’ll probably get more money back or owe less.
            - p: >-
                This is because the <LinkStandardDeduction>standard deduction</LinkStandardDeduction> and tax brackets
                change when two people combine their income and expenses on a joint return. You can file a joint return
                even if one of you had no income or deductions.
            - p: >-
                However, filing separately can sometimes mean you pay less tax. For example, if you have high medical
                expenses, you may be able to deduct more of those expenses. This is because when you file separately,
                you’re reporting less income, which may qualify you to deduct more.
            - p: <strong>Eligibility for tax benefits</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you file a separate return, some credits and deductions aren’t available or can be reduced. For
                example, taxpayers filing separate returns are generally not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit
                (EITC) unless they have a qualifying child and are separated from their spouse. Taxpayers filing
                separate returns will also pay tax on more of their social security benefits.
            - p: <strong>Tax responsibility</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file a joint return and one spouse doesn’t pay the tax due, the other
                may have to. Or, if one spouse doesn’t report the correct tax, both spouses may be responsible for any
                additional taxes assessed by the IRS. One spouse may be held responsible for all the tax due even if all
                the income was earned by the other spouse.

                - li: >-
                    You don’t want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse doesn’t have enough tax withheld
                    or doesn’t pay enough estimated tax
            - p: <strong>Outstanding liabilities</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file a joint return, all or part of your portion of the refund can be
                applied (offset) to your spouse’s legally enforceable past-due federal tax, state income tax, state
                unemployment compensation debts, child support, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student loan. If
                this happens, you can file <LinkForm8379>Form 8379</LinkForm8379> to claim injured spouse relief to get

            - p: <strong>Comparing tax rates</strong>
            - p: >-
                Your filing status helps determine your tax rate. A lower tax rate generally means that less of your
                income is taxed.
            - p: >-
                Tax rates are usually the lowest for the Married Filing Jointly filing status. If you qualify for the
                Head of Household and Married Filing Separately filing status, the tax rate for Married Filing Jointly
                is still usually the lowest.

                Tax rates for the Head of Household filing status are usually lower than tax rates for the Married

          body:
            - p: >-
                Deductions reduce how much of your income gets taxed. When you itemize deductions, you individually list
                each allowed expense and then reduce your taxable income by the total. The standard deduction is an
                alternative that allows you to reduce your taxable income by a set amount, without listing expenses.
            - p: >-
                For many taxpayers the standard deduction amount is higher than the amount they’d get by itemizing. But
                when your individual deductions total more than the amount of the standard deduction, it’s more
                advantageous to itemize.
            - p: >-
                In tax year {{/taxYear}}, the standard deduction amount for married couples filing jointly is at least
                {{/MFJStandardDeduction}}, and at least {{/singleOrMFSStandardDeduction}} for each filing separately.

                If your spouse isn’t totally blind, they must get a certified statement from an eye doctor stating that
                one of these is true:
            - ol:
                - li: They can’t see better than 20/200 in the better eye with glasses or contact lenses.

            - p: >-
                If their eye condition isn’t likely to improve beyond these limits, the statement should include this
                fact. Keep the statement in your records. You won’t need to attach it to your federal tax return, but
                the IRS may need to see it later.
            - p: >-
                If their vision can be corrected beyond these limits only by contact lenses that your spouse can wear
                only briefly because of pain, infection, or ulcers, your spouse can take the higher standard deduction
                for blindness if they otherwise qualify. In that case, select <strong>Yes</strong> for this question.
                Otherwise, answer <strong>No.</strong>

            - p: >-
                Here are a few things that can help you decide if it’s better to file jointly (using Married Filing
                Jointly filing status) or file separately (using Married Filing Separately filing status).
            - p: <strong>Taxes on your income</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file jointly, your tax may be lower than your combined tax if you file
                separately. This means you’ll probably get more money back or owe less.
            - p: >-
                This is because the <LinkSD>standard deduction</LinkSD> and tax brackets change when two people combine
                their income and expenses on a joint return. You can file a joint return even if one of you had no
                income or deductions.
            - p: >-
                However, filing separately can sometimes mean you pay less tax. For example, if you have high medical
                expenses, you may be able to deduct more of those expenses. This is because when you file separately,
                you’re reporting less income, which may qualify you to deduct more.
            - p: <strong>Eligibility for tax benefits</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you file a separate return, some credits and deductions aren’t available or can be reduced. For
                example, taxpayers filing separate returns are generally not eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit
                (EITC) unless they have a qualifying child and are separated from their spouse. Taxpayers filing
                separate returns will also pay tax on more of their social security benefits.
            - p: <strong>Tax responsibility</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file a joint return and one spouse doesn’t pay the tax due, the other
                may have to. Or, if one spouse doesn’t report the correct tax, both spouses may be responsible for any
                additional taxes assessed by the IRS. One spouse may be held responsible for all the tax due even if all
                the income was earned by the other spouse.

            - ul:

                    You don’t want to be responsible for any taxes due if your spouse doesn’t have enough tax withheld
                    or doesn’t pay enough estimated tax
            - p: <strong>Outstanding liabilities</strong>
            - p: >-
                If you and your spouse decide to file a joint return, all or part of your portion of the refund can be
                applied (offset) to your spouse’s legally enforceable past-due federal tax, state income tax, state
                unemployment compensation debts, child support, or a federal nontax debt, such as a student loan. If
                this happens, you can file <LinkForm8379>Form 8379</LinkForm8379> to claim injured spouse relief to get

                Some taxpayers are eligible for more than one filing status. Your filing status is important because it

                Married taxpayers may also be able to use the Head of Household filing status if they’re considered

            - p: <strong>Comparing tax rates</strong>
            - p: >-
                Your filing status helps determine your tax rate. A lower tax rate generally means that less of your
                income is taxed.
            - p: >-
                Tax rates are usually the lowest for the Married Filing Jointly filing status. If you qualify for the
                Head of Household and Married Filing Separately filing status, the tax rate for Married Filing Jointly
                is still usually the lowest.
            - p: >-
                Tax rates for the Head of Household filing status are usually lower than tax rates for the Married
